# Human Activity Recognition (HAR) STM32 model zoo

This directory contains scripts and tools for training, evaluating and deploying HAR models using **TensorFlow** & **STM32Cube.AI**.

## Training
Under [training](training/README.md) you can find a step by step guide plus the necessary scripts and tools to train and evaluate the HAR models on custom and public datasets.

## Evaluate
Under [evaluation](./evaluation/README.md) you can find a step by step guide plus the necessary scripts and tools for evaluating your model performances if datasets are provided.

## Benchmarking
Under [benchmarking](./benchmarking/README.md) you can find a step by step guide plus the necessary scripts and tools to benchmark your model using STM32Cube.AI through our STM32Cube.AI Developer Cloud Services or from the local download.


## Deployment
Under [deployment](../deployment/README.md) you can find a step by step guide plus the necessary scripts and tools to deploy your own pre-trained HAR model on your STM32 board using STM32Cube.AI.

You can also use a pretrained model from our `Human Activity Recognition STM32 model zoo`, check out the available models in [human_activity_recognition/pretrained_models](../pretrained_models/README.md) directory.
