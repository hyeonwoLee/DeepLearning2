# Audio event detection (AED) STM32 model zoo


## Directory components:
* [datasets](datasets/README.md) placeholder for the audio event detection datasets.
* [deployment](deployment/README.md) contains the necessary files to deploy models on an STM32 board
* [pretrained_models](pretrained_models/README.md) a collection of optimized pretrained models on different audio datasets.
* [src](src/README.md) contains tools to train, evaluate, benchmark and quantize your model on your STM32 target.

## Tutorials and documentation: 
* [Complete AED model zoo and configuration file documentation](src/README.md)
* [A short tutorial on training a model using the model zoo](src/training/README.md)
* [A short tutorial on quantizing a model using the model zoo](src/quantization/README.md)
* [A short tutorial on deploying a model on an STM32 board](deployment/README.md)
